

dont forget to add the comparison between CNN,MLP and RESNET 
how to deal with overfitting
there is a correlation between label imbalance and results you get from confusion matrix and f1,accuracy scores
in one slide, add comparison between confusion matrice,accuracy results with  label with highest occurance and label with lowest occuracne'
tell them which metric is best
also look at the klausur pdf and identify potential questions asked
Infer from confusion matrix and accuracy,fi scores for mlp and CNN




Slide 7: Transfer Learning with ResNet50
Pretrained vs Untrained ResNet Results:
Highlight modifications to the final layer for multi-label classification
Training/Validation loss curves (plot)
Metrics comparison: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
Key Insights:
How transfer learning improved performance
Differences between pretrained and untrained ResNet
Slide 8: Model Comparisons
Tabular/Bar Chart Summary:
Compare all models (MLP, CNN, ResNet-pretrained, ResNet-untrained) on metrics:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
Trainable parameters
FLOPs
Visualize the comparison to emphasize differences

Suggestions for improvement (e.g., advanced augmentation, better handling of imbalance, experimenting with other models)
End with a strong takeaway or discussion question for your audience
