Dont forget to mention that the dataset is not balanced (could lead to reduced model perfomance)
try to connect this to the Training and Validation curves of the MLP and CNN 
mention about the 90 label issue
dont forget to add the comparison between CNN,MLP and RESNET 
also add in further optimizations needed
Slide 2

 problem statement (multi label claddification)
 project goals

 Slide 3 
 dataset insights



Slide 7: Transfer Learning with ResNet50
Pretrained vs Untrained ResNet Results:
Highlight modifications to the final layer for multi-label classification
Training/Validation loss curves (plot)
Metrics comparison: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
Key Insights:
How transfer learning improved performance
Differences between pretrained and untrained ResNet
Slide 8: Model Comparisons
Tabular/Bar Chart Summary:
Compare all models (MLP, CNN, ResNet-pretrained, ResNet-untrained) on metrics:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
Trainable parameters
FLOPs
Visualize the comparison to emphasize differences
Slide 9: Handling Imbalanced Data (Optional)
Highlight confusion matrix analysis for underrepresented labels (e.g., poor recall)
Discuss solutions implemented (e.g., class weighting in loss function)
Show improvement metrics after implementing solutions (if done)
Slide 10: Conclusion and Future Work
Key Results:
Summarize best-performing model (ResNet with Transfer Learning?)
Highlight improvements through handling imbalance, augmentation, and hyperparameter tuning
Future Work:
Suggestions for improvement (e.g., advanced augmentation, better handling of imbalance, experimenting with other models)
End with a strong takeaway or discussion question for your audience
